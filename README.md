# Redis Database by Mama Cass and the Redis Tributers

To help distinguish our work, our group decided to separate the repositories by the database we used for this project - Cassandra and Redis.

Below is a link to the Cassandra database:

# About

In this repo, myself, [William Mass](https://github.com/WilliamMass), and [Trina Rutz](https://github.com/catspook) have all of our Redis work for project 2 and 3. You'll find the redis-py code for all queries except query number 5 and the file to insert all our data locally. We have the original data, the assignment instructions, and our reports as well.

# Setup Process (Linux)

i. Update your Linux environment for the latest version - **sudo apt update**
1. Install Redis - Type **sudo apt install redis-server**
2. Run the server - Type **sudo service redis-server start**
3. Run redis-cli - Type **redis-cli**
4. Type **PING** to test if your server is up and running
