## Redis Edition

To help distinguish our work, the group decided to separate the repositories by database.

# About

In this repo, we have all of our Redis work for project 2 and 3. You'll find the redis-py code for all queries except query number 5 and the file to insert all our data locally. We have the original data, the assignment instructions, and our reports as well.
